Angular Seed
============
> To get the ball rolling on our project, Angular offers us a seed project that
> automatically decides architectural organization as well as other default
> modules to speed up our bootstrap project.

It's advised that we do not initialize this within an existing project nor a
larger application. Most times, architectural solutions have already been made
in this scope.

Angular Seed works alongside node modules. As such, we can run our tests with
`npm test` which is gracefully handled by Karma. We can initialize and view the
project via `npm start`. Overall, this a fantastic way to bootstrap our project
for rapid progression.

The main directory where we will be customizing is our application folder.
