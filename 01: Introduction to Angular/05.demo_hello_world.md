Demo Hello World in Angular
===========================
We will now demonstrate our very first example within AngularJS. We being by
importing the angular framework into our markup. I might note that since we are
using the minified version, we must support a map file for debugging purposes.
More of a standard and not necessarily a requirement.

Our HTML tag will indicate that we are building an angular application.
We create an `h1` tag that will indicate, through Angular's custom attribute,
that the header is indeed maintained by a controller. We will use Angular's
template braces to render a value.

Within our custom script we indicate a function that will be our controller.
We use the prefix namespace of `Ctrl` to indicate that is indeed a controller.
We define a scope that will be responsible for all that lives in that
controllers scope. Including the content that we tie it to. We indicate a value
for our scope variable. This value will substitute our template namespace.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en" ng-app>
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>Hello World</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1 ng-controller="HelloWorldCtrl">{{helloMessage}}</h1>

  <script src="angular.min.js"></script>
  <script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8">

    function HelloWorldCtrl($scope) {
      $scope.helloMessage = "Hello World";
    }
    
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```
