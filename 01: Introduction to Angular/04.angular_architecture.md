Angular Architecture
====================
> Angular builds itself on three main architectural decisions.

- **Two Way Binding**: allows your application's DOM to reflect changes
  immediately without having to manually change your HTML when data has been
  updated.
- **Dirty Checking**: you don't have to put your data into special structures of
  getters and setter. You can simply put your models into plain old JavaScript
  objects and Angular will respond when a change occurs.
- **Dependency Injection**: Encapsulates dependencies within other objects thus
  allowing modular code that is testable. 

Angular Components
------------------
The central core of any Angular Application is the controller. The controller
contains logic and state. Controllers speak with views through one and two-way
binding. Views allow the application to interact with the end-user. Finally, our
application logic will live within our services --this includes business logic
and server interaction.
