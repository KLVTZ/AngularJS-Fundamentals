Introduction
============
Client side JavaScript has become more and more complex. AngularJS solves the
problem of spaghetti code with MVC style code.

We will take this course in modules:

1. **Introduction**: shows how simple it is to work with Angular and it's layout.
2. **Controllers & Markup**: how to organize our code into controllers and
   directives.
3. **Services**: Abstract logic out of controllers and into services, which
   makes testing easier.
4. **Routing**: to turn your application into one single page application
6. **Directives**: Exciting and powerful. Directives allow you to handle events
   and changes.
7. **Testing**: Test your controllers, directives, and full end-to-end UI
   testing.
